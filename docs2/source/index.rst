pyranges documentation
======================

pyranges is an open source, MIT-licensed library for high-performance, easy-to
use genomics data structures and methods for the Python programming language. It
provides the data structure PyRanges, a port of GenomicRanges, the foundational
genomics datastructure in the R bioconductor project.

PyRanges has many attractive features which makes it a great choice for genomic analyses

- fast; *in median operations are 2.3 to 9.6 times faster than in R*
- memory-efficient; *pyranges are at least as memory-efficient as their R counterparts*
- featureful; *pyranges support a comprehensive collection of genomic operations*
- easy multi-core support; *all methods, both built-in and user-defined, are easy to make parallel*
- Python science stack interoperability; *pyranges are represented as pandas DataFrames*
- great API; *pyranges fills the holes in the GenomicRanges API*

In addition, it contains fast statistical and feature-aware operations useful
for genomic analyses.

Other libraries in the PyRanges ecosystem:

- ncls
- pyrle
- pyranges-db
